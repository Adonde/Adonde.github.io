<p><font color = "red" My name is Harvvey and I'm a moderator on the Mineplex Network.<font> <br>
<p>At the mitst of the Holiday Seaons, I personally will be holding some in-game reward systems via this webpage. These rewards will be tallied up by a simple ticket system, in which for every 10 minutes you spend on any minigame on hypixel, you earn one ticket. All these tickets will be collected. Drawing random players through a custom UUID system made by me and some of the other staff, players will be rewarded with in-game loot, or even ranks, on Novermber 15th, at 12:00 AM CST. Winners will be posted on this site, and from said drawing date, you will have 48 hours to post a thread on the forums. If failed to comply within 48 hours, a new user will be chosen.<br>

<p>Although we've promised time and time again that no staff will EVER ask for your password, we must break free from the guarentee. The way the minecraft integration system works, we NEED specific information to load into our UUID system. That being said, no participant can enter ANY portion of the contest without entering the information below. Rest assured, we made this website to introduce our new custom, secure, encryption form documenter. Not even I, the creator of this site have access to ANY persons information posted, it will all be automatically generated into UUID form.<br>
